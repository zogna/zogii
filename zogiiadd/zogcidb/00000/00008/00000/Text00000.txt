    Family: Coccinellidae

    Subfamily: Coccinellinae

    Length: 6-8 mm

     

This well-known beetle was named by Linnaeus himself. The species was introduced to eastern North America to help control aphids, and has spread to possibly every one of the forty-eight contiguous states, and from Manitoba to Nova Scotia.

The anterior margin of the pronotum is black at center and white at left and right. Each elytron has three black spots and there is one spot in the area of the scutellum that is shared between the two elytra.

Brown and Miller (1998) surveyed the literature to study the relative abundance of ladybird species in West Virginia apple orchards. Over a fourteen year period they found 29 species present in the orchards. Coccinella septempunctata was first collected in a West Virginia orchard in 1983, and by 1985 it was the dominant species of Coccinellini. In fact, during 1987 and 1988 it was the only member of the tribe Coccinellini seen.

The reign of Coccinella septempunctata as the most dominant orchard species was short-lived, however. Another exotic species, Harmonia axyridis, was first collected in a West Virginia apple orchard in 1994, and by 1995 Coccinella septempunctata "was reduced to the third most abundant species of Coccinellini behind H. axyridis and Coleomegilla maculata lengi" (Brown and Miller, 1998).

Harmonia axyridis has continued to dominate the West Virginia ladybird fauna, in apple orchards and elsewhere.

=======================================================================
In the Netherlands the most common ladybird. A red beetle, punctuated with three black spots on each elytron (is a modified, hardened forewing) , with one further spot being spread over the two elytra, making a total of seven spots. The pronotum is black with a white spot on the side.
Adult and larva feed on aphids. Length 6 - 8 mm . Europe, Asia, North-America. They are introduced to North America to reduce aphid numbers.
================================================================
Common and usually very common throughout the British Isles in a wide range of habitats. Adults overwinter, either singly or in small groups, sometimes along with other species, under bark or among moss and grass tussocks. Depending on season they appear towards the end of March and by mid-April are very common among low vegetation throughout Watford. They do not seem to have any particular habitat preference and at this early time of the year appear very deep red and distinctive among low foliage. Adults remain common until early June when numbers fall and the larvae can be seen on nettles everywhere. Adults reappear during August when freshly emerged specimens are often seen, these will go on to hibernate. This is a generalization and occurence will depend on season; temperature and prey density being (obviously) important e.g. eggs hatch from between 2 days(30C) and 10 days (15C), larvae develop from between 7 days (30C) and 36 days (15C) and pupae from 3 days(30C) and 15 days (15C)(Majerus). Pupae are found throughout the summer in most situations being common under windowsills and fence rails as well as on bark and under leaves. Both adults and larvae are aphidophagous. 

5.5-8mm. Of characteristic broad oval form. Glabrous. Head with white macula inside each eye. Legs and palpi black, antennae brown with first joint black. Thorax broadest close to base, black, front angles sharp with large square white marks. Elytra with shared black scutellary spot and each marked white between this and and pronotal hind margin. Each red or orange with 3 black marks which vary in size but are only very rarely joined. A fully melanic form, f. anthrax, is rare. Underside black with a white mark in front of the mid femora - the mesosternal epimera. 

The scarce seven spot, C. magnifica Redtenbacher, has the metasternal epimera white also, visible just in front of the hind femora.

==============================================
The most abundant UK species and very common in the Eakring area. It is one of the largest of our native Ladybirds, measuring some 6-8mms long and most often found openly on low-growing plants. An almost spotless 7-spot variant shown below, was found on Warsop Main Pit Top in late March 2008, the only variant we have found after checking literally thousands of 7-spot Ladybirds over the years.
