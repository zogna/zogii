Punctures on head about as large as eye facets, separated by 1.0-2.0 diameters; intervals between punctures shiny without microsculpture. Anterior clypeal margin straight. Antenna short and stout. Apical maxillary palpomere, 1.5 times as long as broad, almost parallel-sided. Eyes at frons separated by about 2.2 times eye width. Pronotal base not margined; prosternum long in front of procoxae with broad and forward oriented, setose projection that is about 0.75 times width of prosternum. Prosternal process 0.8 times as wide as transverse coxal diameter. Hypomeron deeply concave with antennal foveae anteriorly. Scutellum pentagonal, setose. Elytral surface densely, punctate; all punctures of similar size and about as large as those on pronotum, setigerous and 2-3 diameters apart; interspaces shiny and without noticeable microsculpture. Epipleuron about 2.2 times as broad as metepisternum, narrowing posteriorly from the level of abdomen and completely absent at very apex. Foveae well defined; the mesofemoral fovea deeply delimited both on metepisternum and epipleuron; the metafemoral one deeply on epipleuron.
