Length 2.3-3.2 mm. Colour dark brown to almost black except for anterior part of clypeus, mouthparts, antennae, apices of tibiae and tarsi and abdomen which are yellow; anterior angles of pronotum sometimes yellow. Dorsum distinctly convex, covered with dense, whitish pubescence not forming patterns. Punctures on head distinctly finer than eye facets, separated by 1.5-2.5 diameters; intervals between punctures shiny without microsculpture. Anterior clypeal margin shallowly and broadly arcuate. Apical maxillary palpomere, as long as broad and almost parallel sided. Eyes weakly emarginate; at frons separated by about 2 times eye width. Pronotal base entirely margined; prosternum very short in front of procoxae with very weak and narrow projection directly in front of coxae. Prosternal process narrow, about 0.3 times as wide as transverse coxal diameter. Hypomeron without distinct foveae. Scutellum pentagonal, setose. Metaventral postcoxal lines arcuate not extending on to metepisternum. Elytral surface irregularly and doubly punctate; larger punctures 2-3 times as large as the pronotal ones, 1.0-1.5 diameters apart, intermixed with much smaller setigerous punctures of variable dispersion; interspaces shiny and without noticeable microsculpture. Epipleuron strongly narrowing posteriorly from the level of abdomen and completely absent from about level of ventrite II; foveae very weakly defined. Meso-metaventral junction 0.8 times as wide as mesocoxa; mesoventrite arcuate and weakly bordered anteriorly. All legs exceptionally narrow and long; with tibiae weakly angulate externally; claws in both sexes appendiculate with basal tooth prominent and sharp. Abdominal postcoxal line recurved and complete; ventrite V straight and simple.
