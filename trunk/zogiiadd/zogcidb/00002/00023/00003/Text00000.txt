Antenna short with strongly asymmetrical club. Apical maxillary palpomere, as long as wide and weakly expanded apically. Eyes at frons separated by about 2.2 times eye width. Pronotal base not margined; prosternum long in front of procoxae with large, forward oriented, setose projection that is about 0.5 as broad as prosternum. Prosternal process 0.4 times as wide as transverse coxal diameter. Hypomeron deeply concave but without distinct foveae. Scutellum pentagonal, setose. Elytral surface densely, irregularly punctate; all punctures of similar size, setigerous and 2-3 diameters apart; interspaces shiny and without noticeable microsculpture. Epipleuron narrow, about as broad as metepisternum, strongly narrowing posteriorly from the level of abdomen and completely absent apically; foveae well defined, mesofemoral fovea delimited both on metepisternum and epipleuron, metafemoral one deeply delimited on a very narrow epipleuron. Meso-metaventral junction about as wide as mesocoxa; mesoventrite straight and bordered anteriorly.
