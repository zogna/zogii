Description
Length 1.0-1.3 mm. Body uniformly brown, appendages yellowish brown. Dorsum covered by mixture of a short and recumbent yellowish pubescence intermixed sparsely with much longer, darker and erect setae. Pronotal disc moderately convex medially with dorsal punctures 1-3 diameters apart, interspaces shiny; lateral borders distinctly thickened anteriorly in lateral aspect forming a double edge for 3/4 of its length; the area between both edges convex, coarsely punctured and setose. The crescent-shaped pit on the prothoracic hypomeron is separated distinctly from the lateral edge but posteriorly its outer margin joins the narrow lateral margin carina. Elytra 2 times as long as pronotum, distinctly narrowing in the apical third; disk punctured and setose, similar in arrangement to pronotum; lateral margins narrow, weakly serrate, but entirely visible from above; epipleuron narrow, incomplete at apical 1/4.
