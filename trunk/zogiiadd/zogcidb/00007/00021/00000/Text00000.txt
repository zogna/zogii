Length 1.1-1.3 mm. Winged; form oval, convex; surfaces apparently glabrous with short setae on dorsum irregular and often absent except for a regular transverse row along pronotal base. Dark brown, ventral side opaque; labrum and appendages yellowish brown. Dorsal surfaces between punctures highly polished, shiny. Head flat, sparsely punctate and shortly setose, punctures as large as eye facets, 3-4 diameters apart, interspaces smooth. Clypeus weakly prominent anteriorly, not forming a rostrum, anterior margin weakly arcuate. Eyes normal, coarsely facetted, dorsally separated by about 3-4 times width of an eye. Antenna 10-segmented with long 3-segmented club. Pronotum widest just before base and gradually narrowing anteriorly, pronotal margins not explanate but entirely visible from above; anterolateral line distinct but not reaching lateral margin. Disc regularly convex, sparsely punctate, punctures twice as large as those on vertex, 2-4 diameters apart with interspaces smooth and shiny. Scutellum elongate, triangular, well visible, glabrous. Elytron shiny, punctate, punctures dual; larger punctures of about size of pronotal ones and mostly in regular rows, usually separated by 1-2 diameters; intervals with much smaller punctures also in regular rows, puncture interspaces shiny and usually polished. Elytral margins smooth, narrow and visible from above at basal 2/3. Epipleuron narrow, extending to level of abdominal ventrite 3. Abdomen: ventrite 5 arcuate posteriorly, usually exposing 6th ventrite apically; postcoxal line of first ventrite incomplete, almost reaching lateral margin, postcoxal disc.
