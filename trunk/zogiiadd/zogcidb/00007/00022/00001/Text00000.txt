Surfaces between punctures highly polished and strongly shiny. Head dorsally flat, regularly punctate, punctures 2 diameters apart, each puncture as large as an eye facets and bearing a long curved seta. Clypeus prominent, weakly arcuate anteriorly. Eyes large, coarsely facetted, dorsally separated by about 2.5 width of an eye. Antenna 10-segmented with narrow 2-segmented club. Pronotum widest at base and distinctly narrowing anteriorly; pronotal margins very narrow and hardly visible from above; anterolateral line very close to the anterior angle, not clearly joining lateral margin. Pronotal disc convex, coarsely punctate, punctures as large as those on frons, 2 diameters apart. Scutellum triangular, large, glabrous. Elytron shiny, sparsely and coarsely punctate, punctures irregular except for sutural row, about as large as those on pronotum and 2-4 diameters apart. Elytral margins narrow, visible from above at basal 1/3. Pubescence composed of curved semi erect hairs and interspaced with about twice as long erect setae. Lateral part of elytron with an epipleural carina very close to margin, forming thickened border and extending to level of abdominal ventrite 2. Abdomen: postcoxal line of first ventrite incomplete but reaching lateral margin, postcoxal disc sparsely punctate.
