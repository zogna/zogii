Black or dark piceous brown; ventral side deeply brown; clypeus, labrum and appendages yellowish brown. Surfaces between punctures highly polished and strongly shiny. Head flat, regularly punctate, punctures irregular, each 0.5-0.7 times as large as an eye facet and bearing a short curved seta. Clypeus prominent, weakly arcuate anteriorly. Eyes large, coarsely facetted, dorsally separated by about twice width of an eye. Antenna 10-segmented with narrow 2-segmented club. Pronotum widest at base and distinctly narrowing anteriorly; pronotal margins very narrow and hardly visible from above; anterolateral line distinct, very close to anterior angle and clearly joining lateral margin. Disc convex, finely and irregularly punctate, punctures as large as those on frons, 2-4 diameters apart. Scutellum triangular, large, glabrous. Elytron shiny, coarsely punctate, punctures dual and mostly in regular rows (especially those on disc); large punctures in rows and bearing long and erect setae, smaller punctures along intervals less regular and bearing short and more inclined setae. The elytral margins narrow, visible from above at basal 2/3 only. Lateral part with the epipleural carina very close to elytral margin, forming thickened border and extending to level of abdominal ventrite 2. Abdomen: postcoxal line of first ventrite reaches lateral margin of abdomen; postcoxal disc without punctures inside.
