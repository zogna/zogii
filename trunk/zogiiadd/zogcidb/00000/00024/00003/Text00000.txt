Another tree-dweller, which is commonest on mature Scots Pine. It is also another large species (up to 7mm) and slightly larger than the Cream-streaked Ladybird. In nearly four years of searching we had found just two Striped Ladybirds - at Sherwood Pines near Edwinstowe in mid-March 2006 and at Clipstone Old Quarter near Edwinstowe, after severe gales brought down many thousands of Pines in late January 2007. In early August 2009, we found more adults on a single matureand very young Scots Pines on Budby South Forest, so more than doubling our previous number of records. This is still a difficult Ladybird to find and there are now just two Sherwood Forest NNR records.
