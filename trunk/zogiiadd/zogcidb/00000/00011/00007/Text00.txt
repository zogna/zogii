This photo taken early morning, when the Fungus-eating Ladybird was behaving somewhat recalcitrantly, not wanting to wander about or even take flight. This ladybird eats mildew fungus, which is enough to make anyone sleepy. Normally fast moving and active fliers, smooth, shiny, yellow on black pattern.
