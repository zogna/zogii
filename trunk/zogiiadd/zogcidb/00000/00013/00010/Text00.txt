==============================
Body length 6mm 
  
The beetle is lemon-yellow in colour, with black lines on its wing-covers resembling network pattern. So we call this beetle Netty Ladybird. We found this ladybird only once in Brisbane. We search around the internet, the only thing we found was a beetle on a Singapore Stamp which look similar to this ladybird (see the reference below).
