Cambridge, garden, various dates 2001-3 
Very variable coloration, forms shown have (from left) almost no markings; 10 pale markings; 10 spots and two small marks; additional spots on the scutellum and the apices of the elytra making 13 in all; 13 spots starting to join up; and (f. decempustulata) the spots fully joined leaving 10 irregular orange blobs. 
Finally, proof that they really are the same species! 
==================================
This ladybird is to recognize by the spots pattern on the pronotum, a "track" on the femur and the short transverse elytral ridge. But the Asian ladybug has the same transverse elytral ridge. It is even more difficult to find the right species, because both species are variable in pattern and colour. In real it is easy, because the ten-spotted ladybird is much smaller. From a photograph it's often difficult to see the differences. Both species have brown orange legs and antennae.
Length: 3,5 - 5 mm. Adult and larva feed on aphids. April - October.
