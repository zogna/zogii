The Water ladybird, locally common throughout southern England, active by early March and can become very common by mid summer. Adults inhabit reedbeds, Phragmites australis or Reedmace (Typha latifola), where they are readily seen crawling among stems during warm weather. By no means confined to this habitat, they are adventitious and may be swept from most waterside vegetation. They overwinter in the adult stage low down among reed stems and, in our experience, are also found in grass tussocks near to water. 

3.5-4.5mm. Distinctive and soon recognised in the field, glabrous and elongate. Ground colour from yellow to orange with characteristic markings as pictured although the spots vary in size and are occasionally fused, 19 in number but from 15 to 21 have been recorded. Pronotum broadest near middle and with 6 dark marks although these may also be fused. Appendages yellow or light brown, claws dark and without teeth. Antennae long, their insertion visible from in front.

=======================================================
A small species which is found on Bulrush and Rushes growing around lakes and rivers etc. We searched for this species for several years, before finding it in numbers at Eakring Flash in July 2009. The Winter is spent in the hollow stems of Bulrush or between a leaf and the stem. The adults are a light buff colour from July onwards, until becoming flushed with red by the Spring months. Possibly quite uncommon in Nottinghamshire, but also likely to be an under-recorded species.
