The Water ladybird, locally common throughout southern England, active by early March and can become very common by mid summer. Adults inhabit reedbeds, Phragmites australis or Reedmace (Typha latifola), where they are readily seen crawling among stems during warm weather. By no means confined to this habitat, they are adventitious and may be swept from most waterside vegetation. They overwinter in the adult stage low down among reed stems and, in our experience, are also found in grass tussocks near to water.
