Quite a scarce ladybird across the UK, with a distinct preference for coastal habitats although can be found on heathland, but as it is a migratory species, it can occasionally turn up unexpectedly. This one was found at rest on a small Pine on Warsop Pit Top on December 28th 2006. It's size (coupled by it's oval shape) means this species is very similar to the Adonis Ladybird, both of which are shown in the above right photograph. The 11-spot Ladybird is the right of the two and is slightly larger, darker red than most Adonis, but also has a different pronotum pattern - this being almost entirely black, but having the appearance of two white "false eyes". 
The NBN Gateway currently lists only two previous Nottinghamshire records, although many insect records from the county fail to make it onto the database. The 11-spot Ladybird is probably still an uncommon species in Notts and almost certainly under-recorded. This was our first record of the species, and finding it at the end of the year was extremely surprising especially after searching for it throughout the Summer months.
