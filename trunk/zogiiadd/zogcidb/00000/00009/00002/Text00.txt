A mildew feeder 
This specimen was found at a lighted window (I've never seen one in the garden in the daytime). 
Right, a standoff with a spider. (I never found out the result).

==========================================================
An orange ladybird with 16 creamy-white coloured spots (sometimes 14 spots). The head and legs are also orange. The eyes are black. Its elytra and pronotum (the hardened plate that protects its thorax and head) are almost transparent around the rim. Frequently found around maples and ashes  
Length: 6-9 mm. Adult and larva feed on mildew in stead of aphids.
April - October. 
On 30 September 2007 I saw this larva on an Euphorbia triangularis. I did not expect a nymph of an orange ladybird on this time and on this plant. The photos of the pupa have been taken on 5 October. Two days before it was still a larva. Like the larvae of the 22 spot ladybird the larvae are yellow
