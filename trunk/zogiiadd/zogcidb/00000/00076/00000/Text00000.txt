Locally common throughout the UK to the northern Scottish highlands. Restricted by habitat; they breed in the crowns of Scots pine and hibernate high up in bark crevices. In our experience they become adventitious in late summer, the few tall Scots pine in Cassiobury park are presumably hosts as during august 2006 adults were taken within a kilometre or so on Cedrus sp. and, along with an abundance of other ladybirds, a pedunculate Copper Beech. They have on several occasions (july, august,sept. 2006) been attracted to MV in the town centre, perhaps understandable as pines are common in local domestic gardens and St. Mary's churchyard. 

4.5-5.2mm. Broad oval, glabrous and entirely light brown to dark red-brown. Antennae obviously longer than width of head including eyes, darkened apically, with loose 3 segmented club, segments 9 and 10 with clearly sinuate anterior margins. Head with pale mark between eyes. Pronotum finely bordered laterally, broadest behind middle. Entire upper surface punctate. Scutellum visible, elytra bordered from scutellum to apex. The pattern of lighter markings on pronotum and elytra make this species unmistakable; pronotum with lateral margins lighter, often broadly so, these usually fused across front margin, and with two median basal marks. Elytra with 8, unusually 7 or 9, lighter marks including a tick shaped mark around the scutellum, the strength of these vary very little. No melanic form is known. Legs distinctly pubescent. Claws smooth, broadened to a blunt tooth at base. 

Description from 2 Watford specimens at X10 
====================================
Although a pretty widespread ladybird in Nottinghamshire, this 18-spot Ladybird was an unexpected find at Haywood Oaks on August 15th 2006. The 18-spot Ladybird is a fairly small species and a tree dweller, showing a preference for the tops of Scots Pines. The background colouration is a rich brown (Cream-spot Ladybird is darker and a larger insect) ID can be clinched by the rounded 'M' mark on the Pronotum. Our second record was not to come until April 2010, when we beat one from a Pine on Budby South Forest, which was the first Sherwood Forest record, since hostorical times.
