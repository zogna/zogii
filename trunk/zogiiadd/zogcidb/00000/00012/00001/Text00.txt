The spot count (as in all ladybirds) includes elytral spots only and includes a half (or less) spot right on each flank. 
Feeds on mildew 
Thea 22-punctata in older references.

========================================
A small bright yellow ladybird with  22  black spots on the elytra. The pronotum of the male seems to be lighter.  
Length: 3 - 4,5 mm.  April - September.
Adult and larva feed on mildew. The larva are bright yellow too.
Europe , North-Africa and Asia.  

============================================
A common grass and meadowlond species throughout England but less so in the north and Scotland. Adults feed on mildews from a variety of plants but are especially common on umbellifers e.g. Hogweed (Heracleum) or Angelica and, in our experience, Oak (Quercus) also. During July and August they may be found just about anywhere. Adults overwinter close to the ground in grass tussocks or under debris and occur in Berlese samples from a range of habitats. Around Watford they have been found active on the underside of Dock (Rumex spp.) throughout the winter. 

3-4.5mm., although small specimens (<2.5mm) occasionally occur, see specimen 3 below. Glabrous. Bright yellow with 11 or very rarely 10 well defined dark spots on each elytron, almost always discrete; fusion between spots is rare. Pronotum with 5 distinct dark marks. Head with characteristic black markings. Antennae, palpi and legs dark yellow, femora extensively darker and outer edge of tibiae black. 

Description from 4 Watford specimens at X20 

=============================================
It took eight months of searching to finally track this species down in order to photograph it. As a mildew feeder, the 22-spot Ladybird is best looked for amongst low vegetation. Searching Hogweed plants infested with mildew proved fruitless, but I eventually found fairly good numbers along the edge of a Pine plantation in Sherwood Forest. The habitat was generally dry, and the was some young Oak re-growth and 22-spot Ladybirds. The 22-spot Ladybird was added to the Eakring list on Augsut 12th 2006, when one was found on Hogweed at Eakring Flash. A small species.
