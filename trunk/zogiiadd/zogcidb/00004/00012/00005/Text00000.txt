Length 4.0-4.7 mm. Male. Dorsal surface reddish, greenish or bluish; pronotum with anterior angles usually greenish, contrasting with the discal colour; elytra with metallic reflection; venter usually pale brownish, except for epipleura and hypomera, which are dark brownish; in some specimens pro-, meso-, and metaventrites and legs dark brownish. Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, not conspicuously deep and somewhat sparse, nearly 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antenna 9-segmented; pedicel about as long as its greatest width; 3rd antennomere slightly shorter than pedicel; 9th elongate, about 2 times longer than basal width. Terminal maxillary palpomere with sides nearly parallel; the apex moderately oblique with outer side about 1.5 times longer than inner; terminal labial palpomere elongate; about 3 times longer than basal width; about as long as preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head, the sculptures much weaker; punctation slightly larger than eye facets, as shallow as on head but more concentrated, approximately 1 diameter apart; the punctures confluent on anterior angles; anterior angles with distinct strigae; lateral borders somewhat oblique; bordering line interrupted at base, the line slightly bent at the lateral border; prosternum moderately long in front of coxae, about 1.5 times longer than prosternal process widest width; hypomeral foveae conspicuous; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws distinctly appendiculate. Elytral surface sculptured as on pronotum; punctation slightly weaker than on pronotum, slightly shallower and sparser; lateral margin weakly reflexed, without clear bead; epipleural foveae conspicuous. Abdomen with 6 ventrites; 6th reduced, sometimes not very obvious in dry specimens, straight to slightly emarginate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, running parallel to posterior margin of ventrite, almost reaching lateral margin; apical border of intercoxal process conspicuously swollen.


Male
Tegmen about 2/3 the abdomen length; penis guide symmetrical, as long as to slightly longer than the parameres; parameres densely setose at apex, the setae long; strut about as long as tegmen; penis as figured.


Female
Female identical to male, except for having only 5 visible abdominal ventrites, the 5th ventrite also rounded but longer than in male, about 2 times longer than 4th, somewhat oval.
