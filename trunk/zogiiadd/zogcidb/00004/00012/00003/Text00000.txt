Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, nearly 1 diameter apart. Eyes with inner margin conspicuously diverging apically. Antenna 8-segmented; pedicel about as long as greatest width; 3rd antennomere slightly shorter than pedicel; 8th broad, slightly longer than basal width. Terminal maxillary palpomere with side parallel; terminal labial palpomere slightly elongate; about 2 times longer than basal width; shorter then preceding segment.
