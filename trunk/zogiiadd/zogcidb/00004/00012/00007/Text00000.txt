Length 3.7 mm. Surface dark brownish, each elytron with 3 orange maculae. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation almost indistinct, smaller than eye facets, very shallow, nearly 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antenna 9-segmented; pedicel about as long as wide; 3rd antennomere slightly shorter than pedicel; 9th broad, slightly longer than basal width. Terminal maxillary palpomere with sides nearly parallel; the apex strongly oblique with outer side about 2 times longer than inner; terminal labial palpomere slightly elongate; about 2 times longer than basal width; visibly shorter than preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head; punctation about as large as eye facets, approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart; the punctures obsolete on anterior angles; anterior angles without distinct strigae; lateral borders rounded; bordering line uninterrupted at base, the line slightly opening anteriorly, then almost reaching lateral border; prosternum short in front of coxae about as long as prosternal process widest width; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws barely widened at base. Elytral surface somewhat coriaceous; punctation similar to pronotum, but difficult to see given the leathery nature of the surface; lateral margin slightly reflexed, without clear bead; epipleural foveae absent. Abdomen with 5 ventrites; 5th rounded at apex; surface of ventrite 1 micro reticulate between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, weakly recurving apically; apical border of intercoxal process flat.
