Length 3.5-4.1 mm.Dorsal surface predominantly metallic brownish; each elytron with 4 yellowish or orange maculae; antennae, labial palp, meso-, and metepimeron, meso-, and metepisternum and abdomen yellowish; rest dark brown. Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, nearly 1.5 to 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antennae 9-segmented; pedicel slightly wider than long; 3rd slightly shorter than pedicel; 9th relatively short, about as long as basal width. Terminal maxillary palpomere with sides nearly parallel; the apex moderately oblique with outer side about 1.5 times as long as inner; terminal labial palpomere slightly elongate; about 2 times longer than basal width; visibly shorter then preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head, the sculptures much weaker; punctation about as large as eye facets, as shallow as on head; approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart; the punctures not confluent on anterior angles, getting slightly deeper; anterior angles without distinct strigae; lateral borders rounded to slightly truncate; bordering line uninterrupted at base; the line slightly opening anteriorly, then almost reaching lateral border. prosternum short in front of coxae, about 1.5 times longer than prosternal process widest width; hypomeral foveae vestigial; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws weakly appendiculate. Elytral surface sculptured as on pronotum; punctation stronger than on pronotum, slightly deeper and more concentrated; about as large as eye facets, approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart; lateral margin slightly reflexed, without clear bead; epipleura foveae vestigial. Abdomen with 6 ventrites; 6th fairly evident; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, recurving apically without reaching the middle of the segment; apical border of intercoxal process slightly swollen.

Tegmen relatively long, slightly more than 2/3 the abdomen length; penis guide symmetrical, slightly longer than parameres; parameres sparsely setose, the setae short; strut as long as penis guide; penis similar to O. bilunulatus.
