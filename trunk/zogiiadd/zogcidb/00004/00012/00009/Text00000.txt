Length 4.7-5.3 mm. Dorsal surface predominantly metallic dark bluish; each elytron with 2 orange maculae as in Figure 46; antennae, labial palp, and last four abdominal ventrites yellowish; rest dark brown. Body elongate, somewhat flattened. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation smaller than eye facets, very shallow, almost indistinct, nearly 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antennae 8-segmented; pedicel about as long as greatest width; 3rd antennomere longer than pedicel; 8th elongate, 2 times longer than basal width. Terminal maxillary palpomere very narrow; sides nearly parallel; apex oblique with outer side about 2 times longer than inner; terminal labial palpomere slightly elongate, about 2 times longer than basal width, visibly shorter then preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head; punctation about as large as eye facets; as shallow as on head, approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart; the punctures obsolete on anterior angles; anterior angles without distinct strigae; lateral borders rounded; bordering line uninterrupted at base, the line slightly opening anteriorly, ending in a weak depression before lateral border; prosternum short in front of coxae about 1.5 times longer than prosternal process widest width; hypomeral foveae absent; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws weakly appendiculate. Elytral surface polished between punctures; punctation as on pronotum, slightly deeper; lateral margin slightly reflexed, without clear bead; epipleural foveae absent. Abdomen 6 ventrites; 6th short, straight to slightly emarginate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 somewhat microstriate between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, running parallel to posterior margin of ventrite, almost reaching lateral margin; apical border of intercoxal process flat.


Male
Tegmen relatively long, about as long as abdomen length; penis guide symmetrical, distinctly longer than parameres; parameres densely setose at apex, the setae short; strut about 1/2 the tegmen length; penis as figured.


Female
Female externally identical to male, except having only 5 visible abdominal ventrites; 5th ventrite rounded, somewhat oval.
