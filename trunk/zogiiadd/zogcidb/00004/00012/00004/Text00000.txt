Length 3.5-4.5 mm. Male. Dorsal surface varying from blue, purple or darkish-brown with varying degree of shine; venter pale brown except for epipleura and lateral extremity of hypomera, which are dark brownish. Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, not conspicuously deep and somewhat sparse, nearly 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Clypeus weakly emarginate. Antennae 9-segmented, very similar to O. lafertei. Maxillary and labial palpomeres also very similar to O. Lafertei. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head, the sculptures much weaker; punctation slightly larger than eye facets, as shallow as on head but more concentrated, approximately 1 diameter apart; the punctures confluent on anterior angles; anterior angles with distinct strigae; lateral borders somewhat oblique; bordering line interrupted at base, the line slightly bent at the lateral border (in some specimens); prosternum moderately long in front of coxae about 1.5 times longer than the prosternal process widest width; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws distinctly appendiculate. Elytral surface sculptured as on pronotum; punctation weaker than on pronotum, slightly shallower and sparser; lateral margin weakly reflexed, without clear bead; epipleural foveae conspicuous. Abdomen with 6 ventrites; 6th very reduced, straight to slightly emarginate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, running parallel to posterior margin of ventrite, almost reaching lateral margin; apical border of intercoxal process conspicuously swollen.


Male
Tegmen relatively short, about 1/3 the abdomen length; penis guide symmetrical, slightly longer than parameres; parameres densely setose at apex, the setae long; strut as long as tegmen; penis as figured.



Female
Female externally similar to male, except having only 5 visible abdominal ventrites, the 5th ventrite also rounded but longer than in male, about 2 times longer than 4th, somewhat oval.
