Length 3.8-4.7 mm. Dorsal surface bluish or greenish, usually shiny; venter pale brown except epipleura and hypomera, which are dark brownish to somewhat purple in some specimens. Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, shallow and sparse, nearly 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antenna 9-segmented very similar to O. lafertei. Terminal maxillary palpomere with sides nearly parallel; the apex moderately oblique with outer side about 1.5 times longer than wide; terminal labial palpomere slightly elongate; about 2 times longer than basal width; slightly shorter than preceding segment. Pronotal surface micro sculptured between punctures; the sculptures somewhat different and much weaker than in head, rugose on disc and reticulate on anterior angles; punctation about as large as eye facets, as shallow as on head, approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart; the punctures not confluent on anterior angles, getting only deeper and sparser; anterior angles without distinct strigae; lateral borders slightly oblique; bordering line interrupted at base, the line visibly bordering the entire lateral border in some specimens; prosternum very long in front of coxae, about 2 times the prosternal process widest width; hypomeral foveae vestigial; hind tibiae with outer tooth; tarsal claws distinctly appendiculate. Elytral surface sculptured as on pronotum; punctation more conspicuous than on pronotum; slightly deeper and sparser; lateral margin slightly reflexed; with clear bead; epipleural foveae conspicuous. Abdomen with 5 ventrites; 5th rounded at apex, somewhat oval; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines; postcoxal lines joined at middle, running parallel to posterior margin of ventrite; apical border of intercoxal process conspicuously swollen.

Tegmen relatively short, slightly longer than 1/2 the abdomen length; penis guide symmetrical, slightly longer than parameres; parameres densely setose at apex, strut as long as tegmen; penis as in O. lafertei.
