Body rounded, convex. Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, shallow, nearly 1.5 to 2 diameters apart. Eyes with inner margin slightly diverging apically. Antenna 9-segmented; pedicel slightly longer than wider; 3rd antennomere slightly shorter than pedicel; 9th broad, slightly longer than basal width.
