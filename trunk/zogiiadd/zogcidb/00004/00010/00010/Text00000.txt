Adults and larvae are predators on scale insects 
(but I have also observed one was mooching around on a rotten pear ...) 
This photo shows the distinctive rim round the margin of the elytra and has identical markings to that at the UK Ladybird Survey. Note, however, that there are forms of the 2-spot ladybird which look very much like this! 


==========================================
Almost entirely black. Only on each black elytron are two red spots. The front spot looks like a comma. It is a small,  round ladybird with a pronounced rim around the edge of the wing cases. This ladybird is common, when pines are around. I find it often on the spindles.  
In 2011 I saw a lava (almost pupa) and a pupa of a pine ladybird..
They feed on scale insects and aphids.
Length 3 - 5 mm. Europe, Asia.


====================================================
Common throughout southern England, rarer in the north and scarce in Scotland. Usually on conifers, with a preference for Pine, but the adults are adventitious and, especially towards the end of summer, are found on a range of trees and shrubs. Adults overwinter on pine, generally in sheltered positions under bark or within cones, sometimes in leaf axils. They usually choose south facing positions. They are active early in the spring on Pine but also in our experience Cedar. On April 11th 2007 two adults were swept from flowering Broom (Cytisus) on Common moor, apparently far from any coniferous trees 1. During August and September they are common in Cassiobury park on a range of deciduous trees (esp. Beech and Oak) as well as on Pine. Newly hatched adults are reddish but attain the typical colour within 24 hours. 
    4.5-5.5mm. Almost circular with narrowly explanate sides to pronotum and elytra, very convex and shining. Elytra with two orange marks 2, subhumeral and below centre, these vary in size but are never fused. Superficially similar to the Kidney spot (Chilocorus renipustulatus (Scriba)), which has a single orange mark to each elytron and apical abdominal sternites red, and the Heather Ladybird (Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.)), which has two or three small red marks forming a transverse pattern across the middle of the elytra. In both these species the front tibiae have a tooth on the outer margin, absent in Exochomus. 

1 Interestingly the Pine Hawkmoth has been found repeatedly on the central part of Common moor. We have yet to find conifer trees nearby.
2 Exochomus nigromaculatus has entirely black elytra and broad yellow lateral margins to the pronotum. An insect of heather heathland with only a few records from Britain. 

====================================================
Normally (but seemingly not totally restricted to) found in woodland areas with an abundance of Pine Trees, this individual was actually found near the back door of a Tuxford Farm, well away from any Pines. It is common UK species, often found on the trunks and branches of Scots Pine and is probably well distributed throughout Nottinghamshire and often common where it occurs.

Description
Length 3.0-3.7 mm. Dorsal surface predominantly black; each elytra with 2 orange marks: a anterolateral one, somewhat U-shaped, reaching the anterior margin but not the lateral one; a post-median one near the suture, not very well defined, somewhat transverse. Venter, predominantly dark-brownish to black; yellowish on epipleura basal half and last four abdominal ventrites. Body elongate, weakly convex. Head flat between eyes; punctation as large as eye facets, approximately 2 diameters apart. Eyes small, dorsally separated by more than 2 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin slightly divergent. Antenna with scape asymmetrical, somewhat constricted in the base; pedicel barrel-shaped, about as long as scape; antennomere 3 trapezoidal, visibly shorter than pedicel; 3-8th transverse, gradually increasing in width; 8th somewhat quadrate; 9th strongly asymmetrical, about as long as 8th; 10th small and partially embedded in the 9th. Terminal maxillary palpomere slightly expanded toward apex; strongly oblique at apex, with outer side about 3 times longer than inner; terminal labial palpomere elongate, as long as penultimate segment.Pronotal surface sculptured as on head, the sculptures much weaker; punctation smaller than eye facets, shallower and sparser than on head, approximately 2 to 3 diameters apart; lateral borders truncate; pronotal base entirely bordered, the bordering line abruptly approaching the margin before it ends in a weak pronotal depression; prosternum long in front of procoxae, about 3 times longer than prosternal process widest width. Elytral surface sculptured as on pronotum; punctures stronger than on pronotum, slightly deeper and more concentrated, about as large as eye facets; lateral margin finely reflexed. Abdomen with ventrite 6 weakly emarginate; surface of ventrite 1 micro reticulate between punctures.

Male
Tegmen relatively short, about 1/2 the abdomen length; penis guide asymmetrical visibly shorter than parameres; parameres densely setose at apex, the setae long; strut about as long as tegmen.


Variation
The sharply marked elytral pattern of red on black, typical of central and northern European specimens, is frequently blurred when the species breeds at temperatures of 20 centigrade or above, a condition frequently found during summer around Perth.
