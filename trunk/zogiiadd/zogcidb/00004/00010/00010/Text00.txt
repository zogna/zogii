Adults and larvae are predators on scale insects 
(but I have also observed one was mooching around on a rotten pear ...) 
This photo shows the distinctive rim round the margin of the elytra and has identical markings to that at the UK Ladybird Survey. Note, however, that there are forms of the 2-spot ladybird which look very much like this!
