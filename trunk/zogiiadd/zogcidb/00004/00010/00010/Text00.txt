Adults and larvae are predators on scale insects 
(but I have also observed one was mooching around on a rotten pear ...) 
This photo shows the distinctive rim round the margin of the elytra and has identical markings to that at the UK Ladybird Survey. Note, however, that there are forms of the 2-spot ladybird which look very much like this! 


==========================================
Almost entirely black. Only on each black elytron are two red spots. The front spot looks like a comma. It is a small,  round ladybird with a pronounced rim around the edge of the wing cases. This ladybird is common, when pines are around. I find it often on the spindles.  
In 2011 I saw a lava (almost pupa) and a pupa of a pine ladybird..
They feed on scale insects and aphids.
Length 3 - 5 mm. Europe, Asia.
