Surface predominantly yellowish; each elytron with 3 brownish maculae; a slightly transverse basal lateral one, a post-median transverse one, constricted medially or completely divided in some specimens, and a small rounded one at apical fifth of elytra. Body slightly elongate and flattened. Head flat between eyes; micro reticulate between punctures; punctation smaller than eye facets, nearly 2.5 diameters apart. Eyes dorsally separated by about 3 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin conspicuously diverging apically. Antenna with scape symmetrical, slightly larger at apex; pedicel barrel-shaped, about as long as scape; antennomeres 3 and 4 very similar in size and shape, somewhat trapezoidal; 5th 1.5 times as long as 4; 6th 1.5 times as long as 5th; 7th somewhat conical in lateral view, slightly shorter than 6th; 8th partially embedded in the 7th. Terminal maxillary palpomere weakly securiform. Terminal labial palpomere robust, about 2 times as long as basal width; slightly shorter than preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head; punctation almost obsolete, very shallow; prosternum relatively long in front of coxae, slightly more than 2 times longer than prosternal process widest width; tarsal claws distinctly appendiculate. Elytral punctation stronger than on pronotum; epipleura narrowing abruptly medially. Abdomen with ventrite 6 slightly emarginate at apex; 5th wider than 4th; surface of ventrite 1 micro sculptured between postcoxal lines; postcoxal line almost reaching midpoint of lateral line.
