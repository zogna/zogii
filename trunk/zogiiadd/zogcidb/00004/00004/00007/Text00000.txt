Description
Length 2.5-2.7 mm. Dorsal surface predominantly yellowish; head dark brownish around the eyes; each elytron with brownish sutural band, sometimes expanded laterally at apex and base; a second longitudinal brownish band running medially, not reaching any margin, distinctly expanded before its apex; meso-, metepimeron, meso-, metepisternum, meso-, metasternum, femora and abdominal ventrites (except the last one) usually dark brownish; the rest yellowish. Body slightly elongate oval and flattened; dorsal surface glabrous. Head flat between eyes; polished to weakly micro reticulate between punctures. Eyes dorsally separated by about 3 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin conspicuously diverging apically. Antenna with scape symmetrical, slightly larger at apex; pedicel somewhat barrel-shaped, about as long as scape; antennomeres 3 and 4 very similar in size and shape, somewhat trapezoidal; 5th 1.5 times as long as 4th; 6th 1.5 times as long as 5th; 7th somewhat conical in lateral view, slightly shorter than 6th; 8th completely embedded in 7th. Terminal maxillary palpomere with sides nearly parallel (Fig. 60); terminal labial palpomere elongate, about 3 times as long as basal width; slightly shorter than preceding segment. Pronotal surface sculptured as on head; punctation smaller than eye facets, nearly 2 to 3 diameters apart; prosternum relatively short in front of coxae, about 1.5 times longer than prosternal process widest width; tarsal claws simple. Elytral surface as on pronotum; punctation weaker than on pronotum, slightly shallower and sparser; epipleura gradually narrowing towards the apex. Abdomen with ventrite 6 truncate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines.
