Length 0.95-1.20 mm; TL/EW= 1.1-1.2. Shortly oval, very convex; broadest slightly behind middle; outer margins of pronotum and elytra only briefly explanate; upper surfaces black; underside and legs pitchy-black, but with mouthparts and tarsi generally paler. Head with frons elongate, little broadened from behind clypeus to vertex; frontal punctures as large as eye facets, generally separated by 1-2 diameters, intervals smooth, setae short, fine, not obscuring surface. Pronotum with anterior border slightly angulate medially; distance between anterior angles 0.7 that between hind angles; lateral borders almost straight from obtuse hind angles to slightly prominent anterior angles; discal punctures larger as those of frons, separated for the most part by 1-1.5 diameter, punctures of lateral margins smaller than those of disc and sparsely set; intervals smooth; pubescence subrecumbent, setae almost all forwardly directed. Elytra with maximum breadth slightly greater than median length; punctures as large or slightly larger than pronotal ones, separation varying from 1-2.5 diameters; intervals smooth; pubescence short, suberect, of uniform length, not arranged in a whorled pattern, similar in appearance to that of rotunda. Prosternum with apex of intercoxal process 0.5 times as broad as hind border of mesoventrite, punctures smaller than most mesoventral punctures, usually separated by 1 diameter; mesoventral punctures separated by 1 diameter; metasternum with punctures of similar size to those of mesoventrite but more sparsely set, especially posteromedially; abdomen with postcoxal plates of 1st ventrite evenly rounded, punctures between hind coxae similar in size and separation to those of metaventral disc; 5th ventrite arcuate apically; surfaces of ventrites 2-5 quite strongly microreticulate, punctures across discs of ventrites 2-4 somewhat irregular, sparse not clearly arranged in a single row on each.
