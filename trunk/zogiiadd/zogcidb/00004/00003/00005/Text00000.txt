Length 1.4-1.7 mm. Oval, convex, broadest shortly before middle; entirely black above; underside and legs also pitchy-black throughout. Head between eyes strongly widened from base of clypeus to vertex, width across vertex as great as or greater than median length; frontal punctures as large as eye facets, separated by 1-2 diameters, intervals smooth, setae in punctures sparse, appressed. Pronotum slightly more than twice as broad at base as median length; anterior border arcuate medially, anterior angles sharply formed; punctures of both disc and margins similar in size to those of frons, but often separated by more than 2 diameters, intervals smooth, pubescence suberect, mostly forwardly directed and with all setae of the same length. Elytra slightly longer than greatest combined breadth; external margins not or very slightly explanate to borders; punctures of disc and margins of similar size and spacing, slightly larger than those of pronotum and often separated by 2 diameters or more, but appearing larger in oblique lighting; intervals smooth, pubescence suberect, forming a whorled pattern. Prosternum with intercoxal process 0.5 times as broad at apex as hind border of mesoventrite, punctures small, sparse, setiferous; mesoventrite sparsely and finely punctured, hind border angled medially; metasternum also sparsely punctured, except anterolaterally, without median discrimen. Abdomen with postcoxal plates of 1st ventrite not recurved, punctures between coxae small and sparse, but larger than those of metasternum;
