Length 1.4-1.5 mm. Shortly oval, convex, broadest at middle; entirely black above with faint, greenish-metallic reflection; underside black or pitchy-black, sometimes with legs lighter in colour. Head between eyes as long as greatest width, frons widened from base of clypeus to vertex; frontal punctures slightly larger than eye facets, mostly separated by 1 diameter or less, intervals smooth, pubescence sparse, fine, not obscuring surface. Pronotum with anterior border arcuate medially, sinuate laterally toward forwardly-produced, very briefly rounded anterior angles; punctures of disc and margins only a little larger than those of frons, separated by 1 diameter or less; most setae forwardly directed and of one length. Elytra as long as greatest combined breadth; external margins not explanate to narrow external borders; punctures of disc and margins slightly larger than those of pronotum, separated for the most part by 1 diameter; intervals smooth, pubescence suberect, of 2 lengths and directionally arranged in a distinctive pattern. Prosternal process 0.5 as broad as base of mesosternum, punctures of process small, shallow, sometimes separated on disc by several diameters; mesoventral punctures small, sparse, separated by 3 diameters, intervals smooth; metaventrite without a longitudinal median sulcus, punctures of disc smaller than those of mesoventrite, separation variable, but often by 2 diameters, punctures toward lateral borders and behind mid-coxae similar in size to those of disc, but somewhat more closely set, intervals roughened toward lateral borders; abdomen with postcoxal plates of 1st ventrite recurved; punctures between coxae mostly small and sparse, a few, much larger punctures also present; 5th ventrite almost as long in midline as ventrites 2-4 together, hind border slightly ogival.
