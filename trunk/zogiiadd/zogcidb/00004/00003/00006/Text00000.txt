Length 1.75-2.4 mm. Oval, convex, broadest at middle; black above; underside largely or wholly black, mouthparts and tarsi sometimes a little lighter-coloured. Head between eyes quadrate, only slightly widened from base of clypeus to vertex, punctures little larger than eye facets, separated by less than 1 diameter, intervals smooth. Pronotum with basal width slightly less than twice median length, distance between anterior angles 0.6 that between hind angles; anterior border obtusely arcuate, angulate medially; lateral borders arcuately narrowed forward from hind angles, more strongly so over anterior third; lateral margins not explanate; discal punctures larger than those of frons, mostly separated by 0.5-1.2 diameter, intervals smooth, punctures on lateral margins 1.5 times as large as discal punctures and separated by 0.5 diameter or less; pubescence subrecumbent, directed anterolaterally on lateral margins and on either side of midline near anterior border, elsewhere pointing forward. Elytra with greatest combined breadth very slightly more than median length, lateral margins not at all explanate; punctures of disc and margins scarcely larger than those of pronotal disc, mostly separated by one diameter, intervals smooth; pubescence of uniform length, mostly suberect, directed to form a symmetrically whorled pattern. Prosternum with apex of intercoxal process 0.6 times as broad as hind mesoventral border, punctures of process large, shallow, mostly separated by one diameter, intervals smooth except for rugulose apical third; mesoventrite with hind border obtusely angled backward, discal punctures c. as large as those of prosternum, variably separated, but often by 1 diameter, intervals smooth; metaventral punctures much smaller and sparser than those of mesoventrite, except just behind mid-coxae, midline with a shallow, longitudinal median impression over most of its length. Abdomen with postcoxal plates of 1st ventrite asymmetrically curved, punctures between plates similar to those of mesoventrite, often separated by one diameter, but usually closer toward posterior border of ventrite.

Male
Frontal surface largely obscured by appressed, golden-yellow pubescence. Abdominal 5th ventrite longer in midline than ventrites 2-4 together, apical margin flattened or slightly emarginate, punctures smaller than those of ventrite 1, separated by 1 diameter or more, intervals largely microreticulate; punctures across discs of ventrites 2-4 not reduced to a single row on each. Tarsal claws of all legs bifid. Male genitalia as illustrated.

Female
With frontal pubescence sparse, not obscuring surface; apical border of 5th abdominal ventrite evenly rounded and tarsal claws very shallowly appendiculate.
