Elytra variable from uniformly blackish to yellow with all intermediate stages; venter yellowish. Head strongly depressed between eyes; with a distinct set of long erected hairs across inner border of eyes; weakly micro reticulate between punctures; punctation obsolete, present only in the clypeal lateral extension. Eyes dorsally separated by slightly less than 2 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin nearly parallel. Antennomere 8 long, about as long as 6th and 7th combined. In bigger males clypeus conspicuously projecting forward at middle, the projection somewhat bidentate at apex, but in smaller specimens clypeus without projection. Terminal maxillary palpomere slightly expanded toward apex; terminal labial palpomere elongate, about 3 times longer than basal width, about as long as preceding segment. Pronotal surface polished between punctures; punctation smaller than eye facets, approximately 2 diameters apart, obsolete on anterior angles; lateral border rounded; prosternum short, slightly shorter than prosternal process widest width. Elytral surface polished between punctures; punctation stronger than on pronotum, slightly deeper and denser, about as large as or larger than eye facets, much larger at lateral margin forming a irregular row across the margin; epipleural foveae conspicuous. Abdomen with ventrite 6 very short, slightly emarginate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 micro reticulate between postcoxal lines.


Male
