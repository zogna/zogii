Surface predominantly yellowish brown or reddish brown, with a dark brown lateral margin of elytra, from the humerus to the apex; a brownish "V" mark occurs on the metaventrite of some individuals. Head flat between eyes; polished between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, nearly 0.5 diameters apart. Eyes dorsally separated by slightly less than 2 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin nearly parallel. Antennomere 8 long, about as long as 6th and 7th combined. Clypeus not projecting forward; slightly emarginate. Terminal maxillary palpomere slightly expanded toward apex; terminal labial palpomere long, about 4 times longer than basal width, longer than preceding segment. Pronotal surface polished between punctures; punctation smaller than eye facets, shallower and sparser than on head, approximately 2 to 3 diameters apart, getting deeper and more concentrated on anterior angles; lateral borders oblique; bordering line present at base, the line visible only on outer margin of anterior angles; prosternum relatively short, about as long as to slightly shorter than prosternal process widest width; hypomeral fovea vestigial, drop-shaped; metaventrite densely covered with long pubescence. Elytral surface polished between punctures; punctation stronger than on pronotum, slightly deeper and more concentrated, about as large as eye facets, larger at the lateral margin; epipleura foveae discreet. Abdomen with ventrite 6 very short, broadly rounded; surface of ventrite 1 polished between postcoxal lines.
