Head micro reticulate between punctures; punctation about as large as eye facets, nearly 1.5 diameters apart. Eyes dorsally separated by slightly more than 2 times the width of an eye; inner ocular margin diverging apically. Antennomeres 5, 6 and 7 about the same length. Clypeus distinctly emarginate medially, with lateral extension markedly narrow. Terminal maxillary palpomere securiform; terminal labial palpomere conical; less than 2 times longer than basal width; distinctly shorter than the preceding segment. Pronotal surface polished between punctures on disc, micro sculptured on anterior angles, the micro sculpture somewhat rugose; punctation smaller than eye facets, shallower than on head, approximately 1.5 to 2 diameters apart, obsolete at anterior angles; lateral borders slightly rounded; prosternum relatively long in front of coxae, slightly more than 2 times longer than prosternal process widest width. Elytral surface polished between punctures; punctation stronger than on pronotum, about as large as to larger than eye facets, slightly deeper; lateral margin slightly reflexed. Abdomen with ventrite 6 relatively conspicuous, broadly emarginate at apex; surface of ventrite 1 polished between punctures; postcoxal line recurving apically, the line fairly distant from the posterior margin.
