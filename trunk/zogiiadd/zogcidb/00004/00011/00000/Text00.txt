A small, black-blue ladybird. Feeds on Cowpea Aphids on Hibiscus and scale insects. Often found on citrus plants, hunting scale insects. Ants tending the aphids aren't able to effectively deter these ladybirds when they hide their limbs under their wing covers.

This Steelblue ladybird is small in size. The wing covers are uniformly shiny dark green in colour. When viewed form the top, the ladybird is a complete circle. We sometimes find them hunting the Cowpea Aphids on our hibiscus plants. They feed on scale insects as well.
