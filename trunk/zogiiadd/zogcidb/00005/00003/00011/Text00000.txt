Surfaces between elytral punctures highly polished, spaces between pronotal and head punctures finely reticulate and feebly shiny; pronotal punctures about as large as frontal ones, somewhat denser laterally than at middle of pronotum, the elytral punctures fine dorsally becoming denser towards lateral margins but always distinctly smaller than the pronotal ones. Ground colour of dorsal and ventral surfaces blackish brown to black; labrum and appendages brown to dark brown. Head flat at middle, regularly punctuate. Clypeus weakly arcuate anteriorly, faintly upturned at anterior edge. Eyes large, coarsely facetted, dorsally separated by about 2.5 times width of an eye. Anterior lobe of prosternum sparsely punctured and not distinctly setose; metaventrite shorter than abdominal ventrite 1 with complete discrimen. Scutellum triangular and very small. Elytral epipleuron yellowish, broad and weakly concave, without distinct foveae, descending externally, with maximum width at the level of metaventrite. Abdomen: postcoxal line curved posteriad and laterad closely paralleling posterior margin for most of length, fading well before attaining lateral margin; postcoxal disc impunctate inside.
